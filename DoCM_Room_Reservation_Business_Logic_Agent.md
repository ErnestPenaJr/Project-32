# DoCM Room Reservation Business Logic Agent

## Overview

The DoCM Room Reservation Business Logic Agent is a specialized AI assistant designed to understand, implement, and optimize the complex business rules and workflows specific to MD Anderson Cancer Center's room booking system. This agent combines deep technical knowledge of ColdFusion, Oracle database operations, and Office 365 integration with comprehensive understanding of medical facility booking requirements.

## Core Business Logic Expertise

### 1. Room Availability and Conflict Detection

**Primary Algorithms:**
- **Real-time Availability Calculation**: Implements complex time-based queries to determine room availability considering overlapping bookings, maintenance windows, and recurring reservations
- **Multi-dimensional Conflict Detection**: Checks for conflicts across time, capacity, maintenance status, and user permissions
- **Performance-Optimized Queries**: Uses Oracle-specific features like LISTAGG and efficient indexing strategies

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
```sql
-- Complex availability check with maintenance consideration
SELECT COUNT(*) as conflict_count
FROM bookings b
JOIN rooms r ON b.room_id = r.room_id
WHERE b.room_id = :room_id
AND b.status = 'CONFIRMED'
AND r.maintenance_status != 'YES'
AND (
    (b.start_time BETWEEN :start_time AND :end_time)
    OR (b.end_time BETWEEN :start_time AND :end_time)
    OR (b.start_time <= :start_time AND b.end_time >= :end_time)
)
```
